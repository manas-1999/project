# project
My project is the books website in which i provided a link for those who want to read books online in "home page".I created the five html pages with the navbar
which helps to linking pages with each other.i also create a page named books where tye user can by the books online where i provided the link 
for amazon to buy them.
The five pages are:
1)Home page:which is the first defailt page of my project.
2)Books :where user can buy the books online.
3)About us:Where I represent myself (i used demo content) with my pic and creted some social links which make the direct contact with the user.
4)trending:It represents the books which are in trending right now which helps the user to know more about the books and encourage them to buy.
5)contact us:i used a simple form format for when user want to contact us or want to give feedback he/she can  easily do that without using any
social media.
Note! This is the demo website therefore i didn't incliude much more items in this project but i aware of the reccomendations of the project for your campus.
